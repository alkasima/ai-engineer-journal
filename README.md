# AI Engineer Journal  

Welcome to my **AI Engineer Journal** — a daily record of my journey to become a job-ready AI Engineer in 90 days.

## About Me

I am an **experienced Backend Engineer (5+ years)** specializing in **Laravel, SaaS applications, and AI integrations**. I have built production-ready AI-powered applications, including:  

- **RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) systems** for document search  
- **AI matching systems** for service providers  
- AI-powered **REST APIs and SaaS applications**  

I am now fully transitioning into **AI Engineering**, focusing on Python, LLMs, RAG systems, and AI infrastructure. My goal is to become a capable AI Engineer ready for full-time positions or freelance AI projects.

## Day 1 – Core Skills

Today marks **Day 1** of my journey. I focused on:  

- Setting up my Python environment for AI experiments  
- Learning the basics of calling **OpenAI / Google Gemini APIs**  
- Experimenting with small Python scripts for AI chat and content generation  
- Documenting code and errors to track learning progress  

**Goal:** Build a foundation that allows me to create AI-powered applications efficiently.

### Notes / Next Steps

- Continue exploring **Python for AI**, including `requests`, `json`, and API handling  
- Begin simple experiments with embeddings and content generation  
- Document every error and fix to share in the journal
